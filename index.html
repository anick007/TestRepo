        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>i am an international student from Bangladesh. Apart from studies (which I am completely not into ) I spend a whole lot of time gaming. I also love to play basketball (which I am not very good at but I am 6'3" and over here in india it gives you a pretty huge advantage ). Anyway I love to make new friends and fall in love w people who feed me pizz</p>
        <p>Apart from the studies, I love to do sketching nd craft work. When it comes to sports, Badminton is my fav nd I always like to play with my friends in the leisure time.Also, I love to do shopping , watching movies, listening to music ,cooking and many more. When it comes to exploring the world around , I would surely mention that I love to travel and meet new people and especially if they are from a different culture than mine as it fascinates me alot. I am quite social. Also, I love to undertake as many volunteer activities as I can. Till my High School, I had almost always been a leader in one or the the other organsations . </p>
